# COMP-2210
Spring 2022 Fundamentals of Computing II

This repository contains all of my coding notes, projects, activities, and other files utilized in the course during the Spring 2022 semester with 
Professor Hendrix. 

The code was completed from scratch by myself, with the help of my peers, textbook resources, other repositories, and internet research on topics I 
previously was unfamiliar with.
